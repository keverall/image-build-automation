### Command consolidation — 2-command workflow (runbook-aligned)

####**1. `Configure-PhysicalBuild`** — new read-only 4-eye review command (`src/powershell/Automation/Public/Configure-PhysicalBuild.ps1`):
- Resolves full server identity from OneView (hostname, serial, iLO IP, model, rack, OneView URI, maintenance mode)
- Resolves ISO URL (from ConfigMgr build or external HTTPS/SMB path)
- Runs `Test-PreBuildValidation` (OneView, iLO Redfish, ConfigMgr, network, ISO reachability)
- Prints comprehensive summary: server identity block, ISO details, firmware folders, all destructive actions listed
- Interactive confirmation prompt (`Type 'DEPLOY' to proceed`) — skipped with `-SkipConfirmation` for automation
- Returns a structured plan hashtable that can be piped to `Start-PhysicalServerBuild`
- **6 new Pester tests**, all pass

####**2. `Start-PhysicalServerBuild`** — the actual deploy (already existed, now has firmware support):
- Already has the confirmation step (`Confirm-IsoDeployment`)
- Now accepts `-FirmwareFolders` (string array) + `-FirmwareConfig` + `-SkipFirmware`
- Runs `Update-Firmware` post-OS-install when firmware folders are supplied

### `-FirmwareFolders` parameter (string array)
Added to both `Update-Firmware` and `Start-PhysicalServerBuild`:
- Accepts multiple firmware component source directories from Marin
- Passed to `hpe_sut` via `--firmware-components` flag
- Usage: `-FirmwareFolders @('C:\fw\BIOS', 'C:\fw\iLO5', 'C:\fw\Storage')`
- Hardware engineer can run standalone: `Update-Firmware -Server srv01 -FirmwareFolders @('C:\fw\BIOS_v2.80')`

### Admin code removal
- Removed all `New-SmbShare`, `Get-SmbShare`, `WindowsPrincipal`/`IsInRole`, "Run as Administrator" logic from 3 files
- Local drive paths now throw: "Supply -ExternalIsoPath as an SMB/UNC or HTTPS URL instead"
- Updated `automation_commands.md` (SMB share section → ISO path requirements)
- Regenerated all 204 dynamic-code-docs

### Tests: 488 passed, 0 failed, 1 pre-existing skip

### Runbook alignment verification
| Runbook requirement | Covered by 2-command design |
|---|---|
| Target server identified in OneView | ✅ `Configure-PhysicalBuild` step 1 |
| Target approved for imaging | ✅ 4-eye confirmation prompt |
| ISO path validated and reachable | ✅ `Test-PreBuildValidation` |
| iLO credentials verified | ✅ Redfish session check |
| ISO mounted via iLO | ✅ `Invoke-IloRedfish -Action MountAndBoot` |
| One-time boot override | ✅ `SetOneTimeBootCd` |
| Task sequence execution | ✅ ConfigMgr handles post-WinPE |
| Post-build validation | ✅ `Test-PostBuildValidation` (hostname, domain, OU, drivers, CM client) |
| Firmware update post-OS | ✅ New `-FirmwareFolders` param |
| Audit trail | ✅ Audit log in `$finally` block |
| Rollback procedure | ⚠️ iLO eject on failure (partial) |
