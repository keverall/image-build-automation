# Private/OneViewSession.ps1 - Shared HPE OneView session helpers
#
# Centralises the logic for detecting and describing an active HPE OneView
# module session (Connect-OVMgmt => $global:ConnectedSessions). Previously
# duplicated across Get-OneViewConnectionStatus, Get-OneViewServerList and
# Disconnect-OneView. Keeping it in one place guarantees all OneView commands
# agree on what "connected" means and use the same user-facing messages.
#

# Standard message returned when no active OneView session exists and no
# explicit -OneViewHost was supplied. Shared so callers stay consistent.
$script:ONEVIEW_NO_SESSION_MSG = "No active OneView session. Use Connect-OVMgmt to connect, or supply -OneViewHost."

function Get-OneViewActiveSession {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Return the first active HPE OneView module session, if present.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Inspects the global $global:ConnectedSessions collection populated by the
        HPEOneView module's Connect-OVMgmt. Returns the first session whose
        Connected flag is true, or $null when none is active. This is the single
        source of truth used by all OneView commands that reuse an existing
        session instead of re-authenticating.

    .OUTPUTS
        [PSObject] The active session object, or $null.

function Test-OneViewSessionActive {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Boolean test for an active HPE OneView module session.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Thin wrapper around Get-OneViewActiveSession that returns $true when a
        connected session exists. Useful for guard clauses and messaging.

    .OUTPUTS
        [bool]
    #>
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param()

    return ($null -ne (Get-OneViewActiveSession))
}

# No proxy manipulation functions needed.
# The test server has firewall rules allowing direct access to OneView appliances.
# Connect-OVMgmt works without any proxy configuration.
